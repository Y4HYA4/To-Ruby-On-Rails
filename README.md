## To start building a web application with Ruby on Rails, you will need to do the following:


<details> <summary>Workflow </summary>

- Install Ruby and Rails: You will need to have the Ruby programming language and the Rails web development framework installed on your machine. You can install them using a package manager such as rbenv or rvm, or you can download and install them manually.

- Create a new Rails project: Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you want to create your project. Then, use the "rails new" command to create a new Rails project. For example: "rails new my_app"

- Set up the database: Rails uses a database to store application data. By default, it uses SQLite, but you can also use other databases such as MySQL or PostgreSQL. You will need to set up your database and configure your Rails application to use it.

- Define your models and controllers: In Rails, models represent the data in your application and controllers handle incoming requests and determine what to do with them. You will need to define your models and controllers and specify how they should interact with your database and views.

- Create your views: Views are the user-facing components of your application. They define the layout and content that will be displayed to users. You can create views using HTML, CSS, and the Rails template language.

- Test and debug your application: As you build your application, you will want to test it to ensure that it is functioning correctly. You can use tools such as the Rails console and the debugger to test and debug your application.

- Deploy your application: When your application is ready to be used by others, you will need to deploy it to a web server. There are many options for hosting Rails applications, including hosting providers such as Heroku or AWS.

Building a web application with Ruby on Rails can be challenging, but it is also a rewarding and fulfilling experience. With time and practice, you will become more comfortable with the framework and be able to build more complex and powerful applications.
